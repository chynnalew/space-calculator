Outline:
create a class (UserAge) with each property housing the age of the user on each planet.

Create prototypes of the class for each planet:
Earth Years - base 1
Mercury year- .24 Earth Years
Venus year- .62 Earth years
Mars year- 1.88 Earth years
Jupiter year- 11.86 Earth years

Life expectancy prototype:
calculate the user's life expectancy on a planet using the average life expectancy in the usa  (78.54 years)

earth life expectancy / .24 = merc life expect (327.25)
merc life expect - this.merc = time left to live ()



# Space Calculator

#### This Epicodus independent project accepts a user inputted age and returns their age and life expectancy on different planets.

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* Jquery
* Node Package Manager
* Webpack
* Jest
* ESLint

## Description
This application was created to show understanding of TDD using the Red, Green, Refactor workflow and Jest. Tests were written for each function, committed before writing the corresponding business logic (after receiving a good fail), committed again after the test passes with business logic, then refactoring the tests as needed. 
Tha application contains the business logic for a space age calculator. The user can input their age and receive their age and life expectancy on Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Life expectancy is calculated based on the age the user believes they will live to on earth.
